TOpSim Global Documentation
================================================

   
TopSim is a generic simulation framework built to benchmark scheduling
approaches for the Square Kilometre Array Science Data Processor. TopSim is
able to model any multi-instrument data-producing system that requires
data-processing; the main TopSim documentation will introduce the key
concepts and demonstrate how this is achieved for the SKA simluations. 

This set of documentation unifies all information on using TOpSim and
helper-libraries, which will provide a background on how to generate scripts
and configuration files for other problem areas like remote-sensing
observations, IoT and Edge computing, and geoscience data ingest.
