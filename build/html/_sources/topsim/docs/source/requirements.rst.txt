Additional Software
===================

TopSim, in addition to the **SimPy** library, makes use of the following Python libraries:

* **numpy**
* **pandas** 
* **matplotlib** 

If you are using Anaconda, or have done any scientific-based programming before, it is likely you already
have these libraries installed on your machine.
